2nd task:
Write a "small system" that allows interaction between a client and a worker, and between a worker and a producer, from the console.
The "small system" should allow the use of CRUD operations to process data. The data should be saved in a file (preferably .txt file).

The system should allow for returning broken items in theoritical on-line shop (not necessarily realistic):
-The client should be able to file a complaint, check the status of filed complaint(filed, verified, possible to pick up, rejected)
-The worker should be able to obtain a complaint, pass it to producer, receive an answer from the producer, pass the decision
regarding the complaint to the client, inform the client of the possible date of return, finish the return
-The producer should be able to obtain the complaint from the worker, accept OR reject it, and pass the information regarding the decision
to the worker

We can assume the following:
There can be multiple clients
There can be multiple producers
There is only ONE worker

The whole task can be done with the use of sockets instead of CRUD operations, in that case the grade would be higher since the sockets
were required for the 5th task.

Student should introduce several custom exception (For example when client wants to get the returned item before the date of return)

Date and time should not be based on local system time, instead a generated date in shared .txt file

Grade: 4.5
Possible Grades: 2.0(Failing) - 5.0;
